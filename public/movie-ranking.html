<hr />

<h3>Rushomon</h3>
<p>Japanese movie from 1950s', it showed me what I had in my for a long time. <br />
About how ones' perspective can be different according to its needs or wants.
</p>

<h3>Somewhere in Time</h3>
<p>A romance movie with time travel. But there's no time machine! <br />
The time travel is done by the will of the traveler to find the true love of his life.
</p>

<h3>Steel Rain</h3>
<p>A Korean dilema movie. The struggle of North and South division. Also how Korea peninsula is so week in whole Asia. <br />
It is a fiction and I wish it were true. Both Koreas united can become the most powerful contry in the world.</p>
